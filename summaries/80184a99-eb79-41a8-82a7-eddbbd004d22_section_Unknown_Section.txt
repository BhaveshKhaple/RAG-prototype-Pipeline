The provided text (File: PrepackagedFSM_unlocked.pdf) details the prepackaged integration between SAP Service Cloud and SAP Field Service Management (FSM).  The document focuses heavily on configuring UI-level integration, enabling seamless transitions between the two systems without requiring repeated logins.  Let's break down the key aspects:

**I.  Address Creation and Replication (Files: PrepackagedFSM_unlocked.pdf, Sources 2, 3):**

This section outlines how addresses are created and handled when data is replicated between SAP Service Cloud and SAP Field Service Management.  Crucially,  addresses are created in FSM *during* replication from SAP Cloud for Customer.  The external ID assigned to the address in FSM depends on the source:

*   **Business Partner:** The address UUID linked to the business partner.
*   **Equipment:**  A registered product ID.
*   **Service Call:** A service ticket ID.

The "address object picker" in the UI uses these IDs to populate the address information, ensuring consistency across both systems.  This process ensures data integrity and prevents the creation of duplicate addresses.

**II. User Interface (UI) Level Integration (Files: PrepackagedFSM_unlocked.pdf, Sources 4-12, 14-18):**

This is the core of the document, explaining how to configure the UI integration between SAP Service Cloud and SAP Field Service Management.  The key prerequisites for this integration are:

*   **Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML:**  This is essential for seamless user experience, eliminating the need for repeated logins when switching between the systems.  Both systems must be configured with SAML for SSO.  The SAP Service Cloud and SAP Field Service Management tenants need to be added to the Identity Provider (IdP), and users must be created within the IdP.

The configuration steps involve:

1.  **Configuring FSM Integration in SAP Service Cloud:** This requires entering the FSM URL prefix (using `https: auth.coresuite.com` for production or a similar address), FSM account details, client ID, and client secret.  The document stresses that the domain is transitioning from `.coresystems.net` and `.coresuite.com` to `.cloud.sap`, with parallel support until 2026.

2.  **Creating a Custom Card for the FSM Dispatching Board:** This allows users to access the FSM dispatching board directly from the SAP Service Cloud home page. The configuration involves creating a custom card, specifying the FSM URL and credentials using a specific format (including base64 encoding of client ID and secret).

3.  **Using the UI-Level Integration:** After configuring the settings, a link to the corresponding FSM service call is activated in the "additional information" section of a ticket in SAP Service Cloud. Clicking this link opens the relevant FSM service call in a new window.  The FSM dispatching board can also be launched directly from the SAP Service Cloud home page via the custom card.

4. **Displaying Service Call in Ticket Document Flow:** This feature adds the service call company ID to the ticket document flow.  This allows users to navigate back to the FSM service call from the SAP Service Cloud ticket.  However,  a successful outbound confirmation is crucial for this functionality, and the document notes potential issues if the confirmation fails. Only one company per account replication from FSM is supported.


**III. Troubleshooting and Further Information (Files: PrepackagedFSM_unlocked.pdf, Sources 19-21):**

The document provides troubleshooting steps for situations where the C4C (Customer for Customer) solution is unavailable, which might interrupt message flow.  It outlines a process for retrying failed message instances within the FSM application.  Finally, it offers links to additional information concerning FSM, the FSM connector, SAP Service Cloud SSO configuration, and SAML integration with FSM.


**IV. Disclaimers and Legal Information (Files: PrepackagedFSM_unlocked.pdf, Sources 22-31):**

This section contains important legal disclaimers concerning external links, videos on external platforms, experimental features, example code, and trademark information.  It clearly outlines the limitations of SAPâ€™s responsibility and liability related to external resources and experimental features.

**Conclusion:**

The document provides a comprehensive guide for configuring the prepackaged integration between SAP Service Cloud and SAP Field Service Management, focusing primarily on the UI-level integration. It explains the process of address creation and replication, detailed configuration steps, the usage of the integrated system, troubleshooting procedures and essential legal disclaimers.  The seamless integration facilitated by SSO with SAML is highlighted as a key feature, improving user experience and efficiency.
