RAG Prototype - Project Report & Strategies
===========================================

Overview
--------
This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prototype is a robust, production-ready system for document Q&A and summarization, designed for deployment with minimal friction. It leverages Google Gemini for LLM-powered answers, Sentence Transformers for semantic search, and Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

Key Features
------------
- PDF and TXT document ingestion with smart chunking
- Semantic embeddings and fast vector search
- Chapter/section/page metadata extraction for context-aware retrieval
- Adaptive context retrieval (broad vs. specific queries)
- Gemini-powered summarization and Q&A with source citation
- Caching of summaries to minimize LLM calls
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Metrics dashboard for system and query performance
- Modular, extensible codebase

Strategies & Best Practices
--------------------------
1. **Robust Error Handling**
   - All file, model, and API operations are wrapped in try/except blocks.
   - User-facing errors are clear and actionable in the UI.
   - The app halts gracefully if critical dependencies (embedding model, API key) are missing.

2. **Metadata-Driven Chunking**
   - PDF structure is parsed with regex to extract chapters and sections.
   - Each chunk carries metadata: chapter_title, chapter_number, section_title, page_number, etc.
   - Enables chapter/section-aware summarization and retrieval.

3. **Adaptive Retrieval**
   - Query intent is detected (broad vs. specific) to adjust the number of context chunks (`k`).
   - Ensures broad questions get more context, while specific queries remain focused.

4. **Token-Aware Summarization**
   - Large chapters/sections are summarized iteratively (map-reduce) to fit LLM context windows.
   - Summaries are cached for efficiency and cost savings.

5. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Specialized prompts for Q&A and summarization tasks.
   - Prompts instruct the LLM to cite sources, structure answers, and clarify ambiguity.

6. **User Experience**
   - Streamlit UI provides clear feedback, tooltips, and error messages.
   - Users can view which chunks were used for each answer.
   - Metrics dashboard offers transparency into system health and performance.

7. **Security & Deployment**
   - API keys are loaded only from environment variables; never hardcoded.
   - All dependencies are pinned to stable versions.
   - The codebase is ready for containerization and cloud deployment.

Testing & Validation
--------------------
- The included `test_setup.py` script verifies:
  - File structure and required directories
  - All package imports
  - Environment variable setup
  - Embedding model loading
  - Gemini API connectivity
- All errors are reported with actionable solutions.

Deployment Recommendations
--------------------------
- Run `test_setup.py` before deployment to ensure environment readiness.
- Use a `.env` file for API keys as described in the README.
- For production, consider containerizing with Docker and using Streamlit's recommended deployment practices.
- Optionally, add a healthcheck endpoint and custom server config for cloud environments.

Future Enhancements
-------------------
- Support for more document formats (DOCX, PPTX, etc.)
- Advanced chunking strategies (semantic, sentence-based)
- Multi-language support
- User feedback loop for answer quality
- Export and reporting features
